	abstract = {IntroductionEndovascular thrombectomy (EVT) is a highly effective treatment for acute ischaemic stroke due to large arterial occlusion (LAO). To support decisions about service provision, we previously estimated the annual UK population eligible for EVT as ?10\% of stroke admissions. Since then, several trials have produced evidence that could alter these figures. We update our estimates considering information from studies and trials reporting 2018?2021 on incidence, presentation time and stroke severity and consider the possible impact of predicted demographic changes in the next 10?20 years.Patients and MethodsWe produce an updated decision tree describing the EVT eligible population for UK stroke admissions. One-way sensitivity analyses (using upper and lower confidence intervals for estimates at each branch of our decision tree) were used to identify where further research evidence is necessary to increase certainty around estimates for numbers of EVT eligible patients.ResultsThe updated estimate for the number of UK stroke patients eligible for EVT annually was between 10,020 (no advanced imaging in early presenting patients) and 9,580 (advanced imaging in all early presenting patients), which compared with our estimates in 2017 is a minimal reduction. One-way sensitivity analyses established that enhanced evidence about eligibility for milder strokes, ASPECTS scores and pre-stroke disability are offset by evidence regarding a lower incidence of LAO. Importantly, predicted increases in life expectancy by 2040 may increase thrombectomy need by 40\%.DiscussionInformation from additional randomised trials published during 2018?2020 with updated estimates of LAO prevalence had a minimal impact on overall estimates of stroke patients eligible for EVT in the UK. Ongoing research into the benefits of EVT for patients with mild stroke or European Stroke Journal For Peer Review lower ASPECTS scores has the potential to increase the estimates of the eligible population; future need for EVT will increase with the ageing population.ConclusionOur updated analyses show overall numbers eligible little changed, but evidence from ongoing trials and demographic changes have the potential to increase the need for EVT significantly.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose:

The optimal recanalization strategy for acute ischemic stroke with large vessel occlusion continues to be an area of active interest. Network meta-analysis can provide insight when direct comparative evidence is lacking.

Methods:

A systematic review of the literature using PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and SinoMed was performed, and a search was conducted for clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and StrokeCenter.org. Four independent reviewers conducted the study selection, data abstraction, and quality assessments.

Results:

The literature review identified 17 trials including 3236 patients and 8 ongoing clinical trials. Sample sizes ranged from 7 to 656 participants. Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) was the most common intervention, followed by IVT plus mechanical thrombectomy (MT), IVT plus intraarterial thrombolysis, intraarterial thrombolysis alone, and MT alone. In the pooled network meta-analysis, IVT+MT was associated with a higher rate of independent functioning. In contrast, IVT was ranked as the most ineffective treatment strategy with respect to neurological functions, while direct MT was ranked as the least safe intervention with respect to all-cause mortality. Also, irrespective of assessment tools, endovascular treatment plus IVT led to higher successful recanalization rate than thrombolysis alone.

Conclusions:

Compared with other recanalization treatments, IVT+MT seems to be the most effective strategy, without increasing detrimental effects, for thrombolysis-eligible patients with large vessel occlusion-acute ischemic stroke. To improve the current evidentiary basis for recanalization treatment, future trials and real-world studies are warranted and should use unified definitions of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and recanalization.},

	abstract = {Ischemic stroke is a treatable disease with alteplase, a clot-busting medical treatment, and endovascular therapy (EVT), mechanical removal of the clot through a minimally invasive procedure. The effectiveness of both treatments is time dependent, and they are usually given together. Alteplase is less effective than EVT, but is widely available at community hospitals; EVT is highly effective, but it is only available at large urban tertiary hospitals. There is uncertainty if it is better to receive alteplase early and delay EVT or vice versa. We developed a conditional probability model based on decay curves that were generated from pooled clinical trials, and then created a software solution using C\# that interfaced with ArcGIS’s Software Development Kit and Google’s Distance Matrix API. The maps were developed based on pre-specified time interval variables to determine the best transportation for multiple US states (Colorado, Arizona, Tennessee, and Massachusetts/Rhode Island) and Northern Ireland.

	abstract = {IntroductionIn ischaemic stroke care, fast reperfusion is essential for disability free survival. It is unknown if bypassing thrombolysis centres in favour of endovascular thrombectomy (mothership) outweighs transport to the nearest thrombolysis centre for alteplase and then transfer for endovascular thrombectomy (drip-and-ship). We use conditional probability modelling to determine the impact of treatment times on transport decision-making for acute ischaemic stroke.Materials and methodsProbability of good outcome was modelled using a previously published framework, data from the Irish National Stroke Register, and an endovascular thrombectomy registry at a tertiary referral centre in Ireland. Ireland was divided into 139 regions, transport times between each region and hospital were estimated using Google?s Distance Matrix Application Program Interface. Results were mapped using ArcGIS 10.3.ResultsUsing current treatment times, drip-and-ship rarely predicts best outcomes. However, if door to needle times are reduced to 30 min, drip-and-ship becomes more favourable; even more so if turnaround time (time from thrombolysis to departure for the endovascular thrombectomy centre) is also reduced. Reducing door to groin puncture times predicts better outcomes with the mothership model.DiscussionThis is the first case study modelling pre-hospital transport for ischaemic stroke utilising real treatment times in a defined geographic area. A moderate improvement in treatment times results in significant predicted changes to the optimisation of a national acute stroke patient transport strategy.ConclusionsModelling patient transport for system-level planning is sensitive to treatment times at both thrombolysis and thrombectomy centres and has important implications for the future planning of thrombectomy services.},

With optimal treatment times (door-to-needle time: 30 minutes; door-in-door-out time: 50 minutes; door-to-groin-puncture time: 60 minutes [mothership], 30 minutes [drip and ship]), both options estimate similar outcomes when the centers are 60 minutes or less apart. However, with increasing travel time between the 2 centers (90 or 120 minutes), drip and ship is favored if the patient would have to travel past the thrombolysis center to reach the endovascular therapy center or if the patient would arrive outside the alteplase treatment time window in the mothership scenario. Holding other variables constant, if treatment times are slow at the thrombolysis center (door-to-needle time: 60 minutes; door-in-door-out time: 120 minutes), the area where mothership estimates the best outcomes expands, especially when the 2 centers are close together (60 minutes apart or less).

The study modeling suggests that transport decision making is context specific and the radius of superiority of the transport strategy changes based on treatment times at both centers, transport times, and the triaging tool used.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose:

Patient-centered care prioritizes patient beliefs and values towards wellbeing. We aimed to map functional status (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] scores) and health-related quality of life on the European Quality of Life 5-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D) to derive utility-weighted (UW) stroke outcome measures and test their statistical properties and construct validity.

Methods:

UW-mRS scores were derived using linear regression, with mRS as a discrete ordinal explanatory response variable in 8 large international acute stroke trials. Linear regression models were used to validate UW-mRS scores by assessing differences in mean UW-mRS scores between the treatment groups of each trial. To explore the variability in EQ-5D between individual mRS categories, we generated receiver operator characteristic curves for EQ-5D to differentiate between sequential mRS categories and misclassification matrix to classify individual patients into a matched mRS category based on the closest UW-mRS value to their observed individual EQ-5D value.

Results:

Among 22 946 acute stroke patients, derived UW-mRS across mRS scores 0 to 6 were 0.96, 0.83, 0.72, 0.54, 0.22, −0.18, and 0, respectively. Both UW-mRS and ordinal mRS scores captured divergent treatment effects across all 8 acute stroke trials. The sample sizes required to detect the treatment effects using UW-mRS scores as a continuous variable were almost half that required in trials for a binary cut point on the mRS. Area under receiver operator characteristic curves based on EQ-5D utility values varied from 0.66 to 0.81. Misclassification matrix showed moderate agreement between actual and matched mRS scores (kappa, 0.68 [95\% CI, 0.67–0.68]).

Conclusions:

Medical strategies that target avoiding dependency may provide maximum benefit in terms of poststroke health-related quality of life. Despite variable differences with mRS scores, the UW-mRS provides efficiency gains as a smaller sample size is required to detect a treatment effect in acute stroke trials through use of continuous scores.

The Rapid Arterial oCclusion Evaluation (RACE) scale was designed based on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) items with a higher predictive value of LVO on a retrospective cohort of 654 patients with acute ischemic stroke: facial palsy (scored 0-2), arm motor function (0-2), leg motor function (0-2), gaze (0-1), and aphasia or agnosia (0-2). Thereafter, the RACE scale was validated prospectively in the field by trained medical emergency technicians in 357 consecutive patients transferred by Emergency Medical Services to our Comprehensive Stroke Center. Neurologists evaluated stroke severity at admission and LVO was diagnosed by transcranial duplex, computed tomography, or MR angiography. Receiver operating curve, sensitivity, specificity, and global accuracy of the RACE scale were analyzed to evaluate its predictive value for LVO.
In the prospective cohort, the RACE scale showed a strong correlation with NIHSS (r=0.76; P{\textless}0.001). LVO was detected in 76 of 357 patients (21\%). Receiver operating curves showed a similar capacity to predict LVO of the RACE scale compared with the NIHSS (area under the curve 0.82 and 0.85, respectively). A RACE scale ≥5 had sensitivity 0.85, specificity 0.68, positive predictive value 0.42, and negative predictive value 0.94 for detecting LVO.
The RACE scale is a simple tool that can accurately assess stroke severity and identify patients with acute stroke with large artery occlusion at prehospital setting by medical emergency technicians.},

	abstract = {Background In 2015, five randomised trials showed efficacy of endovascular thrombectomy over standard medical care in patients with acute ischaemic stroke caused by occlusion of arteries of the proximal anterior circulation. In this meta-analysis we, the trial investigators, aimed to pool individual patient data from these trials to address remaining questions about whether the therapy is efficacious across the diverse populations included. Methods We formed the HERMES collaboration to pool patient-level data from five trials (MR CLEAN, ESCAPE, REVASCAT, SWIFT PRIME, and EXTEND IA) done between December, 2010, and December, 2014. In these trials, patients with acute ischaemic stroke caused by occlusion of the proximal anterior artery circulation were randomly assigned to receive either endovascular thrombectomy within 12 h of symptom onset or standard care (control), with a primary outcome of reduced disability on the modified Rankin Scale (MRS) at 90 days. By direct access to the study databases, we extracted individual patient data that we used to assess the primary outcome of reduced disability on MRS at 90 days in the pooled population and examine heterogeneity of this treatment effect across prespecified subgroups. To account for between-trial variance we used mixed-effects modelling with random effects for parameters of interest. We then used mixed-effects ordinal logistic regression models to calculate common odds ratios (cOR) for the primary outcome in the whole population (shift analysis) and in subgroups after adjustment for age, sex, baseline stroke severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score), site of occlusion (internal carotid artery vs M1 segment of middle cerebral artery vs M2 segment of middle cerebral artery), intravenous alteplase (yes vs no), baseline Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score, and time from stroke onset to randomisation. Findings We analysed individual data for 1287 patients (634 assigned to endovascular thrombectomy, 653 assigned to control). Endovascular thrombectomy led to significantly reduced disability at 90 days compared with control (adjusted cOR 2·49, 95\% CI 1·76-3·53; p{\textbackslash}textless0·0001). The number needed to treat with endovascular thrombectomy to reduce disability by at least one level on MRS for one patient was 2·6. Subgroup analysis of the primary endpoint showed no heterogeneity of treatment effect across prespecified subgroups for reduced disability (pinteraction=0·43). Effect sizes favouring endovascular thrombectomy over control were present in several strata of special interest, including in patients aged 80 years or older (cOR 3·68, 95\% CI 1·95-6·92), those randomised more than 300 min after symptom onset (1·76, 1·05-2·97), and those not eligible for intravenous alteplase (2·43, 1·30-4·55). Mortality at 90 days and risk of parenchymal haematoma and symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage did not differ between populations. Interpretation Endovascular thrombectomy is of benefit to most patients with acute ischaemic stroke caused by occlusion of the proximal anterior circulation, irrespective of patient characteristics or geographical location. These findings will have global implications on structuring systems of care to provide timely treatment to patients with acute ischaemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion. Funding Medtronic.},

	abstract = {Summary
Background
Early administration of intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) after ischaemic stroke improves outcome. Previous analysis of combined data from individual patients suggested potential benefit beyond 3 h from stroke onset. We re-examined the effect of time to treatment with intravenous rt-PA (alteplase) on therapeutic benefit and clinical risk by adding recent trial data to the analysis.
Methods
We added data from ECASS III (821 patients) and EPITHET (100 patients) to a pool of common data elements from six other trials of alteplase for acute stroke (2775 patients). We used multivariate logistic regression to assess the relation of stroke onset to start of treatment (OTT) with treatment on favourable 3-month outcome (defined as modified Rankin score 0–1), mortality, and occurrence and outcome of clinically relevant parenchymal haemorrhage. The presence of an arterial occlusion was inferred from the patient's symptoms and absence of haemorrhage or other causes of ischaemic stroke. Vascular imaging was not a requirement in the trials. All patients with confirmed OTT within 360 min were included in the analysis.
Findings
Treatment was started within 360 min of stroke onset in 3670 patients randomly allocated to alteplase (n=1850) or to placebo (n=1820). Odds of a favourable 3-month outcome increased as OTT decreased (p=0·0269) and no benefit of alteplase treatment was seen after around 270 min. Adjusted odds of a favourable 3-month outcome were 2·55 (95\% CI 1·44–4·52) for 0–90 min, 1·64 (1·12–2·40) for 91–180 min, 1·34 (1·06–1·68) for 181–270 min, and 1·22 (0·92–1·61) for 271–360 min in favour of the alteplase group. Large parenchymal haemorrhage was seen in 96 (5·2\%) of 1850 patients assigned to alteplase and 18 (1·0\%) of 1820 controls, with no clear relation to OTT (p=0·4140). Adjusted odds of mortality increased with OTT (p=0·0444) and were 0·78 (0·41–1·48) for 0–90 min, 1·13 (0·70–1·82) for 91–180 min, 1·22 (0·87–1·71) for 181–270 min, and 1·49 (1·00–2·21) for 271–360 min.
Interpretation
Patients with ischaemic stroke selected by clinical symptoms and CT benefit from intravenous alteplase when treated up to 4·5 h. To increase benefit to a maximum, every effort should be taken to shorten delay in initiation of treatment. Beyond 4·5 h, risk might outweigh benefit.

	abstract = {Background Alteplase is effective for treatment of acute ischaemic stroke but debate continues about its use after longer times since stroke onset, in older patients, and among patients who have had the least or most severe strokes. We assessed the role of these factors in affecting good stroke outcome in patients given alteplase. Methods We did a pre-specified meta-analysis of individual patient data from 6756 patients in nine randomised trials comparing alteplase with placebo or open control. We included all completed randomised phase 3 trials of intravenous alteplase for treatment of acute ischaemic stroke for which data were available. Retrospective checks confirmed that no eligible trials had been omitted. We defined a good stroke outcome as no significant disability at 3-6 months, defined by a modified Rankin Score of 0 or 1. Additional outcomes included symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (defined by type 2 parenchymal haemorrhage within 7 days and, separately, by the SITS-MOST definition of parenchymal type 2 haemorrhage within 36 h), fatal intracranial haemorrhage within 7 days, and 90-day mortality. Findings Alteplase increased the odds of a good stroke outcome, with earlier treatment associated with bigger proportional benefit. Treatment within 3·0 h resulted in a good outcome for 259 (32·9\%) of 787 patients who received alteplase versus 176 (23·1\%) of 762 who received control (OR 1·75, 95\% CI 1·35-2·27); delay of greater than 3·0 h, up to 4·5 h, resulted in good outcome for 485 (35·3\%) of 1375 versus 432 (30·1\%) of 1437 (OR 1·26, 95\% CI 1·05-1·51); and delay of more than 4·5 h resulted in good outcome for 401 (32·6\%) of 1229 versus 357 (30·6\%) of 1166 (OR 1·15, 95\% CI 0·95-1·40). Proportional treatment benefits were similar irrespective of age or stroke severity. Alteplase significantly increased the odds of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (type 2 parenchymal haemorrhage definition 231 [6·8\%] of 3391 vs 44 [1·3\%] of 3365, OR 5·55, 95\% CI 4·01-7·70, p{\textbackslash}textless0·0001; SITS-MOST definition 124 [3·7\%] vs 19 [0·6\%], OR 6·67, 95\% CI 4·11-10·84, p{\textbackslash}textless0·0001) and of fatal intracranial haemorrhage within 7 days (91 [2·7\%] vs 13 [0·4\%]; OR 7·14, 95\% CI 3·98-12·79, p{\textbackslash}textless0·0001). The relative increase in fatal intracranial haemorrhage from alteplase was similar irrespective of treatment delay, age, or stroke severity, but the absolute excess risk attributable to alteplase was bigger among patients who had more severe strokes. There was no excess in other early causes of death and no significant effect on later causes of death. Consequently, mortality at 90 days was 608 (17·9\%) in the alteplase group versus 556 (16·5\%) in the control group (hazard ratio 1·11, 95\% CI 0·99-1·25, p=0·07). Taken together, therefore, despite an average absolute increased risk of early death from intracranial haemorrhage of about 2\%, by 3-6 months this risk was offset by an average absolute increase in disability-free survival of about 10\% for patients treated within 3·0 h and about 5\% for patients treated after 3·0 h, up to 4·5 h. Interpretation Irrespective of age or stroke severity, and despite an increased risk of fatal intracranial haemorrhage during the first few days after treatment, alteplase significantly improves the overall odds of a good stroke outcome when delivered within 4·5 h of stroke onset, with earlier treatment associated with bigger proportional benefits.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thrombolysis is of net benefit in patients with acute ischaemic stroke, who are younger than 80 years of age and are treated within 4·5 h of onset. The third International Stroke Trial (IST-3) sought to determine whether a wider range of patients might benefit up to 6 h from stroke onset.
METHODS: In this international, multicentre, randomised, open-treatment trial, patients were allocated to 0·9 mg/kg intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) or to control. The primary analysis was of the proportion of patients alive and independent, as defined by an Oxford Handicap Score (OHS) of 0-2 at 6 months. The study is registered, ISRCTN25765518.
FINDINGS: 3035 patients were enrolled by 156 hospitals in 12 countries. All of these patients were included in the analyses (1515 in the rt-PA group vs 1520 in the control group), of whom 1617 (53\%) were older than 80 years of age. At 6 months, 554 (37\%) patients in the rt-PA group versus 534 (35\%) in the control group were alive and independent (OHS 0-2; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1·13, 95\% CI 0·95-1·35, p=0·181; a non-significant absolute increase of 14/1000, 95\% CI -20 to 48). An ordinal analysis showed a significant shift in OHS scores; common OR 1·27 (95\% CI 1·10-1·47, p=0·001). Fatal or non-fatal symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage within 7 days occurred in 104 (7\%) patients in the rt-PA group versus 16 (1\%) in the control group (adjusted OR 6·94, 95\% CI 4·07-11·8; absolute excess 58/1000, 95\% CI 44-72). More deaths occurred within 7 days in the rt-PA group (163 [11\%]) than in the control group (107 [7\%], adjusted OR 1·60, 95\% CI 1·22-2·08, p=0·001; absolute increase 37/1000, 95\% CI 17-57), but between 7 days and 6 months there were fewer deaths in the rt-PA group than in the control group, so that by 6 months, similar numbers, in total, had died (408 [27\%] in the rt-PA group vs 407 [27\%] in the control group).
INTERPRETATION: For the types of patient recruited in IST-3, despite the early hazards, thrombolysis within 6 h improved functional outcome. Benefit did not seem to be diminished in elderly patients.

	abstract = {Background The best strategy to identify patients with suspected acute ischemic stroke and unknown vessel status (large vessel occlusion) for direct transport to a comprehensive stroke center instead of a nearer primary stroke center is unknown. Methods and Results We used mathematical modeling to estimate the impact of 10 increasingly complex prehospital triage strategy paradigms on the reduction of population-wide stroke-related disability. The model was applied to suspected acute ischemic stroke patients in (1) abstract geographies, and (2) 3 real-world urban and rural geographies in Germany. Transport times were estimated based on stroke center location and road infrastructure; spatial distribution of emergency medical services calls was derived from census data with high spatial granularity. Parameter uncertainty was quantified in sensitivity analyses. The mothership strategy was associated with a statistically significant population-wide gain of 8 to 18 disability-adjusted life years in the 3 real-world geographies and in most simulated abstract geographies (net gain -4 to 66 disability-adjusted life years). Of the more complex paradigms, transportation of patients with clinically suspected large vessel occlusion based on a dichotomous large vessel occlusion detection scale to the nearest comprehensive stroke center yielded an additional clinical benefit of up to 12 disability-adjusted life years in some rural but not in urban geographies. Triage strategy paradigms based on probabilistic conditional modeling added an additional benefit of 0 to 4 disability-adjusted life years over less complex strategies if based on variable cutoff scores. Conclusions Variable stroke severity cutoff scores were associated with the highest reduction in stroke-related disability. The mothership strategy yielded better clinical outcome than the drip-'n'-ship strategy in most geographies.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose- Direct transportation to a center with facilities for endovascular treatment might be beneficial for patients with acute ischemic stroke, but it can also cause harm by delay of intravenous treatment. Our aim was to determine the optimal prehospital transportation strategy for individual patients and to assess which factors influence this decision. Methods- We constructed a decision tree model to compare outcome of ischemic stroke patients after transportation to a primary stroke center versus a more distant intervention center. The optimal strategy was estimated based on individual patient characteristics, geographic location, and workflow times. In the base case scenario, the primary stroke center was located at 20 minutes and the intervention center at 45 minutes. Additional sensitivity analyses included an urban scenario (10 versus 20 minutes) and a rural scenario (30 versus 90 minutes). Results- Direct transportation to the intervention center led to better outcomes in the base case scenario when the likelihood of a large vessel occlusion as a cause of the ischemic stroke was {\textgreater}33\%. With a high likelihood of large vessel occlusion (66\%, comparable with a Rapid Arterial Occlusion Evaluation score of 5 or above), the benefit of direct transportation to the intervention center was 0.10 quality-adjusted life years (=36 days in full health). In the urban scenario, direct transportation to an intervention center was beneficial when the risk of large vessel occlusion was 24\% or higher. In the rural scenario, this threshold was 49\%. Other factors influencing the decision included door-to-needle times, door-to-groin times, and the door-in-door-out time. Conclusions- The preferred prehospital transportation strategy for suspected stroke patients depends mainly on the likelihood of large vessel occlusion, driving times, and in-hospital workflow times. We constructed a robust model that combines these characteristics and can be used to personalize prehospital triage, especially in more remote areas.},

	abstract = {Various instruments are used to describe poststroke functional outcome, with limited consensus as to optimal end-point for clinical trial use. Many of the popular assessment tools are administered with little formal guidance on best practice. Thus there is potential for substantial heterogeneity in functional outcome assessment poststroke, with consequent effects on trial quality. We examined functional assessment methodology in recent stroke trials. We reviewed six journals representing high-impact international publications in the fields of: stroke (Stroke); neurology (Neurology, Lancet Neurology) and internal medicine (Lancet, New England Journal Medicine; Journal of the American Medical Association). Journals were hand searched for all interventional studies in stroke patients between 2001 and 2006 inclusive. Chosen manuscripts were then analyzed for outcome assessment methodology. We identified 126 trials, comprising a mix of early hypothesis generating studies through to multicentre trials (phase I: four trials; phase II: 46 trials; phase III: 20 trials; noninvestigational medicinal product studies: 56 trials). The median number of patients assessed per trial was 100. Across the trials, 47 different outcome measures were used. One hundred trials had functional outcome assessment as the primary study end-point. The median number of outcome measures was two per trial (range 1?9). The modified Rankin scale was the most prevalent outcome assessment (64·3\%); followed by Barthel index (40·5\%). A minority of trials (33·3\%) provided full details on outcome assessment methodology. Among these trials there was substantial heterogeneity in data collection procedures. There is heterogeneity in the use of functional outcome measures in stroke trials. This compromises comparison and meta-analysis. Trialists continue to use poorly validated approaches to outcome assessment. Given the potential effects on data quality, explicit description of methodology should be mandatory for all trials and rigour is desirable.},
