# General notes for inclusion

*  Generally, from MJ: itâ€™s worth noting that Stroke have published much of the stuff from Broderick et al who have plugged the utility-weighted mRS, so that might be preferable ahead of IJS

# Introduction

Include 5 paragraphs:
* Background - stroke and benefit of IVT & MT
* Problem being addressed: planning services and benefit of IVT and MT under different service models
* What do we know: dichotomised outcome models. mRS 'non-linear' so use utility-weighted mRS 
* What we don't know: more detailed models on mRS, shift, Utility
* What does this work address and how
