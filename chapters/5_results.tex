\caption{The effect of bypassing an IVT-only unit in order to travel directly to a MT-capable unit that is 60 minutes away from the IVT-only unit. Results are for treatable patients (IVT and/or MT), with a mix of 35\% LVO and 65\% nLVO. Arrival-to-IVT is assumed to take 30 minutes, and arrival to MT is assumed to take 90 minutes. An ambulance is assumed to arrive at the patient 60 minutes after stroke onset. Drip and ship is assumed to cause a 60 min delay to MT in additional to transfer time. Concentric circles represent 5 minutes travel time intervals from IVT-only unit. Left: Additional time required to attend the MT-capable unit  directly. Middle: Change in added utility by directly attending the MT-capable unit. Right: Change in population reduced average mRS by directly attending the MT-capable unit. Blue shades represent benefit, red shades represent disbenefit.}

Right: advantage of mothership over drip and ship. Arrival-to-IVT is assumed to take 30 minutes, and arrival to MT is assumed to take 90 minutes. An ambulance is assumed to arrive at the patient 60 minutes after stroke onset. Drip and ship is assumed to cause a 60 min delay to MT in additional to transfer time. White circles show locations of IVT-units, and red circles show locations of IVT/MT units.}
